# Description of the project
This is the first part of the project that simulates an airbnb application in which we are creating a way to control the modules that our web page is going to use by intervening a database in json format. Here we apply object oriented programming, python data translation and command interpreted logic to deliver a local database that can be modified by commands.
# Description of the command interpreter:
## How to start it
1. Clone the repository using ```git clone```
2. CD into the repository
3. Run the command ```./console.py```
   You should see the following prompt: ```(hbnb)```
## How to use it
These are the following commands available within the console program:
* create - Create an instance based on given class
* destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID
* show - Shows an object based on class and UUID
* all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class
* update - Updates existing attributes of an object based on the class name and UUID
* quit - Exits the program
